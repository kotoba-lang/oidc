(ns oidc.adapters.jwt-claims
  "The parts of ID-token verification that are decisions rather than crypto:
  which JWK signed this, and are the claims acceptable.

  ## Why this namespace exists

  `oidc.adapters.jwt-rsa` verifies on the JVM (`java.security.Signature`) and
  `oidc.adapters.jwt-edge` verifies in a Cloudflare Worker (WebCrypto). Those
  two cannot share the signature step — one is synchronous and one returns a
  Promise — but they MUST share the answer to \"is this token acceptable\".

  A second copy of `claim-error` is not a duplication smell, it is a security
  bug waiting for its first divergence: the day one side gains a clock-skew
  allowance, or stops checking `nbf`, or starts accepting an array `aud` the
  other rejects, tokens become acceptable on one deployment and not the other
  — and the JVM side is where the tests live, so the edge is where the gap
  would go unnoticed.

  Everything here is pure and platform-free: maps in, keyword out."

  Expiry is checked whenever the token carries it, because a token with no
  `exp` is a different (worse) problem than an expired one and is not this
  function's to conflate.

  Order matters for the message the caller reports, not for safety: every

  omitting `kid` is a configuration this cannot disambiguate, and picking the
  first is the same behaviour the JVM adapter has always had.
