  "Real-key proof for the WebCrypto RS256 verifier.

  The JVM adapter is covered by `jwt_rsa_test.clj` under the cognitect
  runner; this one needs an actual WebCrypto implementation, so it runs on
  nbb (Node's global `crypto.subtle`) rather than on the JVM:

    nbb --classpath src:test -m oidc.adapters.jwt-edge-test

  It generates a keypair, signs a token with it, and then attacks the token —
  a verifier that only ever sees valid input has not been tested."
